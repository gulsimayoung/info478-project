    very user-friendly.  With this website, we hope to present 
    information in an accessible way in order to highlight certain 
    trends in U.S. health insurance and how it differs from the 
    system in other countries.  The Health Expenditure tab focuses on
    presenting trends across the globe in how much funding is allocated
    to healthcare.  This provides global context for the U.S. system and 
    numbers.  The Health Coverage tab goes into more depth on the trends 
    that are seen within the United States relating to health insurance. 
    In presenting this information, our goal is to 
    increase understanding of how the U.S. healthcare system works and what
    some of its flaws are. Finally, the Resources tab connects users to
    information and services to help them find new or improved healthcare 
    coverage in the United States.  Being covered by a health insurance
    plan makes navigating the healthcare system more manageable.")
